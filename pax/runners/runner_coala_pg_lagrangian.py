"""Runner for COALA-PG on a constrained-welfare Lagrangian.

Solves the constrained welfare problem with one individual-rationality
constraint per player -- the same two constraints as
`runner_welfare_evo` (there: ``mu1``/``mu2`` against
``v_ref_shaper``/``v_ref_opponent``):

    max_theta  W(theta)
    s.t.       R_s(theta) >= tau_s        (the shaper)
               R_o(theta) >= tau_o        (the co-player)

with Lagrangian

    L(theta, lam) = W + lam_s * (R_s - tau_s) + lam_o * (R_o - tau_o).

Because each constraint is itself an expected return, every term is an
expectation over the SAME trajectories, so the Lagrangian gradient is just the
COALA-PG gradient of a reshaped reward:

    r_mix = (r_s + r_o) + lam_s * r_s + lam_o * r_o
          = (1 + lam_s) * r_s + (1 + lam_o) * r_o.

Nothing in the learning-aware estimator changes. Relative to
`runner_coala_pg.CoalaPGRunner`, exactly three things differ:

  1. the trajectory carries a welfare stream plus one stream per constraint,
  2. the baseline comes from one critic head per return, combined as
     ``V_W + sum_k lam_k * V_k``,
  3. one lam controller per constraint runs after each meta-trajectory.

The rollout structure, the co-player, and `coala_advantages` are untouched,
which is what lets a selfish / welfare / constrained comparison be attributed
to the objective rather than to the optimizer.

WHY TWO MULTIPLIERS AND NOT ONE. They do different jobs. ``lam_s`` pulls the
shaper back from self-sacrifice; ``lam_o`` protects the co-player from being
exploited. With only ``lam_s``, the co-player's sole defence is the welfare
term, and welfare is indifferent between (-10, -30) and (-30, -10) -- so the
"cooperation" the shaper converges to can be an exploitative split that happens
to sum well. Both constraints together are what make the claim "cooperation is
established in the asymmetric setting" mean individual rationality for BOTH
players.

Reference for the dual update: Stooke, Achiam & Abbeel, "Responsive Safety in
Reinforcement Learning by PID Lagrangian Methods", ICML 2020. Setting a
constraint's ``kp = kd = 0`` recovers RCPO (Tessler et al., 2019) dual ascent
exactly, so the dual-ascent baseline needs no separate runner.

Two modelling choices that matter more than the controller gains:

  * THE CONSTRAINT WINDOW. A floor on a player's average return over the whole
    meta-episode can be satisfied early and violated late, after the co-player
    has converged -- the opposite of "shaping established cooperation".
    ``window`` restricts a constraint to the last K inner episodes, making tau
    a statement about where the co-player ENDS UP.
  * THE SCALE OF v_ref. Constraint returns are normalised to a PER-INNER-EPISODE
    scale, so tau can be read straight off the payoff matrix (e.g. the
    mutual-defection payoff, which makes each constraint exactly the
    individual-rationality condition and "self-sacrifice" the well-defined
    event R < v_ref). If the ES/Shaper runs define their floor on total
    meta-episode return instead, rescale one of them so the constraints mean
    the same thing on both optimizers.

CONFIG. Flat `welfare.*` keys, with the reference values named exactly as in
the constrained-welfare ES runner and the `coala_objective:
constrained_welfare` configs, so one override sweeps a reference value and it
means the same thing everywhere:

    ++welfare.v_ref_shaper=-15 ++welfare.v_ref_opponent=-20

Every other setting (`kp`, `ki`, `kd`, `lam_init`, `lam_max`, `ema_beta`,
`constraint_window`) may be given once for both players or per player with a
`_shaper` / `_opponent` suffix, the suffixed form winning:

    ++welfare.ki=0.005                 # both
    ++welfare.ki_opponent=0.002        # just the co-player's dual

`++welfare.constrain_opponent=False` drops a constraint entirely, which is the
ablation showing both constraints are load-bearing.
