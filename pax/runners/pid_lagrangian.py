"""PID Lagrangian multiplier controller.

Stooke, Achiam & Abbeel, "Responsive Safety in Reinforcement Learning by PID
Lagrangian Methods", ICML 2020. Reference implementation: OmniSafe's
``PIDLagrangian``.

Plain dual ascent (RCPO, Tessler et al. 2019) is a pure integrator on the
constraint violation: lam only moves once a violation has already accumulated,
so it lags into the violation and then overshoots coming out. Adding a
proportional term (reacts to the current violation) and a derivative term
(reacts to the violation getting *worse*) makes lam respond before the primal
has been driven deep into the infeasible region.

Sign convention here. The constraint is a FLOOR on a return:

    R_s >= tau

Written as a cost constraint ``J_c <= d`` with ``J_c = -R_s`` and ``d = -tau``,
the violation is

    delta = J_c - d = tau - R_s          (positive == violated)

so a satisfied constraint gives delta < 0 and drains the integrator. This
module is deliberately free of JAX: lam is a scalar updated once per
meta-trajectory on the host, and keeping it in plain Python makes it trivial to
test, log, and checkpoint.

Setting ``kp = kd = 0.0`` reduces the update to ``lam <- max(0, lam + ki*delta)``,
which is exactly RCPO dual ascent with step size ``ki``. That is intentional:
the same code path provides the dual-ascent baseline for ablations.

          lam_init: initial multiplier. Deliberately > 0 by default -- early in
            meta-training the constraint is often satisfied by accident, and a
            multiplier initialised at 0 decays further, so by the time real
            violations appear the shaper has already learnt a self-sacrificing
            policy and lam has to climb from nothing to undo it.
          lam_max: optional ceiling. None leaves lam unbounded, which is the
            textbook method; a finite value trades exact feasibility for a
            bound on how far the objective can be tilted.
          lam_min: floor on the multiplier (default 0, the textbook method).
            A floor at the shaper's myopic INDIFFERENCE POINT (1.0 when the
            co-player's multiplier is 0, see the IPD config) removes the
            within-episode pull toward unconditional cooperation entirely:
            below the floor every term of the primal gradient is the
            learning-aware future-episode term, and the constraint only ever
            ADDS a push toward defection when the shaper is actually
            sacrificing. Measured on IPD: with floor 0 the multiplier drains
            to ~0.4 after a violation and the policy falls back into the
            sucker basin before the co-player has responded.
          ema_beta: if > 0, the controller sees an exponential moving average
            of the measured return instead of the raw per-iteration value.
            COALA-PG meta-trajectory returns are noisy and a derivative term on
            raw noise is mostly noise, so smoothing matters more here than in
            single-agent safe RL.
